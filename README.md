# SQLAlchemy_Challenge

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database, I looked at precipitation and station data. With SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I plotted the findings to better understand the weather trends in Honolulu, Hawaii over the last 12 months. This analysis included temperature observations (TOBS) of the highest, lowest, and average temperatures durirng this time period.

Part 2: Design Your Climate App

With the climate data, I created a Flask API based on the queries developed. Routes were created for precipitation, station, TOBS, start, and start-end range data. I jsonified the API data to create a valid JSON response object.
